## Description

  Ansible Collection: Bootstrap

  This collection provides a set of bootstrap roles designed for Debian-based systems,
  serving as a lightweight alternative to Cloud-init. It automates initial host
  provisioning and configuration tasks, enabling consistent and repeatable setup
  of Debian-based environments without relying on Cloud-init.
